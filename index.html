        Goal-oriented college student, graduating high school with a 4.0 GPA with strong leadership skills. My experience includes adept conflict resolution, teamwork skills, and a background in customer service. I am eager to bring these qualities to a role at your establishment and contribute effectively. I am currently shifting my focus to apply psychological studies and research within a law environment. I held a dynamic role that revolved around strategic leadership. I supervised class committees, coordinated school events, ensured recognition for campus groups, and effectively managed a team of four class secretaries. 
Within our team of 51 officers, I was honored to be among the 6 "cabinet officers," a group entrusted with delicate leadership responsibilities. 
I actively traveled to leadership conferences and events. These opportunities allowed me to speak and share my leadership strategies. Ultimately Vista Del Lagoâ€™s Student Government was named one of Californiaâ€™s best.I served as a 2-year officer and President, I implemented and managed my high school's first Favors For Foster Kids Holiday Drive, now an annual event. I organized 100+ volunteers/members and created a campus-wide drive, raising over $8,000 in goods. I facilitate communications between department heads on campus. I manage and lead monthly meetings.I engaged in weekly journal discussions, where I had the opportunity to present medical research papers. Additionally, I shadowed undergraduate students, Ph.D. candidates, and medical professionals, gaining insights into their roles and responsibilities. As part of a neurobiology lab, I observed relationships between titi monkeys as well as voles. Dr. Balesâ€™ lab focused on a potential treatment for Autism Spectrum Disorder. I delved into the study of the hormone oxytocin and immersed myself in understanding our working mind.
<br><br>

        During my tenure as the Student Government President, I took initiative in community outreach programs, collaborating with local businesses and organizing events to foster positive relationships between the school and the broader community. This not only strengthened the school's ties with local entities but also provided valuable learning experiences for the students involved.

In my role as a high school officer, I realized the importance of effective communication and collaboration. I facilitated open channels of communication between student government members and various department heads, ensuring a cohesive approach to addressing campus issues and implementing positive changes. Monthly meetings served as platforms for exchanging ideas and resolving concerns, creating a more inclusive and harmonious school environment.

My commitment to community service extended beyond the school grounds. Initiating the Favors For Foster Kids Holiday Drive, I demonstrated leadership in organizing a successful annual event that garnered substantial support from the community. This experience enhanced my organizational and project management skills, illustrating my ability to mobilize resources for a noble cause.

In my academic pursuits, I actively engaged in neuroscience research, participating in weekly journal discussions and gaining practical experience in a neurobiology lab. My work focused on the study of oxytocin and its potential implications in treating Autism Spectrum Disorder. This exposure allowed me to witness firsthand the intricate relationships among titi monkeys and voles, contributing to my understanding of behavioral research.

Through these diverse experiences, I have cultivated a multifaceted skill set, blending leadership, communication, and a passion for psychological studies. I am excited about the prospect of applying these skills and knowledge in a legal environment, where I believe my unique background can contribute to innovative solutions and a positive impact.
